## About the TEA Platform

Our technology stack ensures that the TEA platform is not only powerful and reliable but also accessible to users with different levels of technical expertise.

At its core, the platform features a web application built with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, known for its fast and modern approach to building interactive web applications.

On the backend, the TEA platform is powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python web framework that offers robust backend capabilities, including a straightforward API for data management. Data can be stored in [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases, providing options for lightweight to more scalable storage solutions.

The platform also supports easy installation and deployment through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), making it straightforward to set up in various environments, including [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us).
