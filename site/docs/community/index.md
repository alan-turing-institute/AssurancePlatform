# Community of Practice

Welcome to the Community page of the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Platform documentation. At the heart of the TEA Platform is a commitment to fostering a vibrant and engaged community of practice. We believe that the challenges of ethical assurance in data-driven technologies are best addressed collaboratively, bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise. Building a community around the platform not only enriches the user experience but also strengthens the integrity and impact of the assurance cases developed through it.

## Building Our Community Infrastructure

We are currently in the process of building out our community infrastructure for the TEA Platform. This includes developing forums, collaborative tools, and resources to support our members in their assurance case work. Our goal is to create a dynamic and supportive environment that facilitates meaningful interactions and collaborations within the community.

    We are excited about the potential of the TEA Platform to bring together a community of practitioners passionate about ethical technology governance. If you are interested in talking further about our community development efforts or wish to contribute, please reach out to the Research Application Manager, Kalle Westerling, at kwesterling@turing.ac.uk. We welcome your insights, expertise, and enthusiasm as we work together to build a community that reflects our shared values and goals.

Together, we can build a community that not only advances the field of technology assurance but also ensures that the development and application of data-driven technologies are conducted ethically, transparently, and inclusively.

## Our Commitment to Community Values

The TEA Platform is guided by core values that shape our approach to developing a community of practice:
