## Using GitHub issues to share TEA cases and seek feedback

GitHub issues are a powerful tool for collaboration and communication within the software development community. Using GitHub issues to share TEA cases and seek feedback is an excellent way to leverage the collective expertise of the community.

When sharing TEA cases on GitHub, leveraging issues can significantly enhance the feedback loop, allowing you to refine and improve your assurance cases with contributions from a wide audience.

Collaborating via GitHub might enhance the quality of your assurance cases. But that's not all: it also fosters a culture of open sharing and continuous improvement within the ethical assurance domain.

This section guides you on how to use GitHub issues effectively to share your TEA cases and seek valuable feedback.

### Creating a GitHub Issue for Sharing a TEA Case

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Open the GitHub repository where your TEA case is hosted. <!-- TODO: [ADD LINK TO SHARE TEA CASES ON GITHUB] -->
2. **Open the Issues Tab**: Click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the repository page.
3. Click the **"New issue"** button to start drafting your issue. Give your issue a clear title that indicates it’s about sharing a TEA case for feedback. In the description, provide context about the assurance case, including its goals, the specific areas where you're seeking feedback, and any particular challenges you're facing.
4. Include a **direct link to the assurance case file** (preferably the raw file link if it’s in JSON format for easy import) or to the folder containing the case if there are multiple related files.
5. **Apply relevant labels** to your issue, such as "feedback-wanted", "TEA case", or "help wanted", to make it easily discoverable for contributors interested in those topics.

### Engaging with Feedback

-   **Monitor Your Issue**: Stay active and responsive to any comments or feedback provided on your issue. Engaging with contributors not only helps in refining your TEA case but also builds a collaborative community atmosphere.
-   **Addressing Feedback**: Update your TEA case based on the feedback received, if applicable. You can commit changes to your case file and mention the updates in the issue to keep participants informed.
-   **Close the Issue**: Once you've gathered sufficient feedback and made necessary adjustments to your TEA case, thank the contributors for their input and close the issue. You can always open new issues as your case evolves or as new feedback needs arise.

### Best Practices for Using GitHub Issues

-   When seeking feedback, **be as specific as possible** about the areas of the TEA case you're looking to improve. This helps contributors provide targeted and useful suggestions.
-   **Consider creating issue templates for sharing TEA cases** if you plan to do this regularly. Templates can help standardize the information you provide, making it easier for others to understand and contribute.
-   **Invite others to contribute** not just by commenting but also by suggesting edits through pull requests if they have significant improvements or corrections to offer.

## TEA Platform Repository Discussions and Issues

The TEA (Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance) platform's [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform) serves as a central hub for community engagement, feature development, and issue tracking.

It is our aim to make it a vibrant community space where users, developers, and stakeholders can collaborate to enhance the platform's functionality and usability. We want you all to come together to make the platform better for everyone. By engaging in discussions, reporting issues, requesting features, and contributing to the codebase, you play a vital role in the continuous improvement and success of the TEA platform.

Below, we discuss how you can actively participate in discussions, report issues, request new features, and contribute to the platform's development.

### Engaging in Discussions

The [repository's Issues](https://www.github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/issues) section is an excellent place for initiating discussions on a wide range of topics, including feature requests, bug reports, and general queries about the TEA platform. This section is where you can voice your thoughts and contribute to ongoing conversations, whether you've encountered a technical glitch, have an idea for a new feature that could improve the platform, or simply have a question about how something works.

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a problem or an error while using the TEA platform, we encourage you to report it via the [repository's Issues](https://www.github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/issues) section.

This information is invaluable in diagnosing and resolving issues more efficiently.

### Requesting Features

The TEA platform is continually being developed, and user feedback is a crucial driver of this process. If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please share it as a feature request<!-- TODO add link straight to feature request--> in the Issues section. Describe your proposed feature, its potential benefits, and how it could be implemented within the platform. Community feedback on these proposals can help prioritize development efforts.

### Contributing to the Codebase

For users with programming experience interested in contributing to the TEA platform, the [repository](https://www.github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/issues) contains detailed instructions on how to contribute to the codebase. Whether it's developing new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation, your contributions are welcome. Here's how you can get started:

**Read the Contribution Guidelines**: Before making any contributions, please review [repository's Issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
