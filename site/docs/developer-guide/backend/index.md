# Backend Documentation for the TEA Platform

Welcome to the backend documentation of the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Platform. This segment is dedicated to providing a deep dive into the backend architecture, built on the robust [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. The backend serves as the backbone of the TEA Platform, handling data management, API interactions, and the integration with SQL-based databases to ensure secure and efficient processing of assurance cases.

## Overview

The TEA Platform's backend is designed to offer a scalable and secure API, facilitating seamless interactions between the frontend application and the underlying database. It supports the creation, retrieval, editing, and deletion of data, thereby enabling the dynamic functionalities experienced on the client side. The choice of Django as the development framework brings to the platform the advantages of rapid development, clean design, and the strength of Python for backend logic.

## Key Sections

[Installation and Setup**](installation.md): Here, you'll find comprehensive instructions on setting up the backend environment for the TEA Platform. From installing Python and Django to initializing the database with SQLite for development or configuring PostgreSQL for production deployments, this guide ensures you have the backend up and running smoothly.

[**Django Settings**](django-settings.md): This section outlines the configuration and settings of the Django framework that are crucial for the operation of the TEA Platform. It covers how to adjust settings for different environments (development, testing, production), including database configurations, security settings, and application-specific options.

[Backend Management Files**](backend-management-files.md): Delve into the key files and directories that constitute the backend structure, including models, views, serializers, and URL configurations. This guide provides an explanation of the roles these files play in the backend architecture and how they interact to support the platform's functionalities.

[API Documentation**](api/index.md): A detailed exploration of the API endpoints available in the TEA Platform's backend, facilitating interaction between the frontend React application and the database. This documentation here is essential for developers looking to understand or extend the platform's API capabilities.

## Connecting Frontend and Backend

The interactivity and dynamic features of the TEA Platform's frontend are powered by the RESTful API provided by the backend. [React](../frontend/index.md) components make HTTP requests to the API endpoints to fetch, display, and manage assurance cases and related data, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. This integration highlights the importance of understanding both sides of the platform for comprehensive development and customization.

## Database Technologies

The backend supports various SQL-based databases, with SQLite being the default choice for ease of setup and suitability for development and testing phases. For scalable production environments, PostgreSQL is recommended, and [guidance is provided for deploying this on cloud services like Azure](../deployment/azure.md).

## Getting Started

Whether you're a developer interested in contributing to the backend, a system administrator tasked with deploying the platform, or simply curious about the inner workings of the TEA Platform, these documentation sections offer valuable insights and practical guidance. By understanding the backend architecture, you can effectively contribute to or customize the platform, ensuring it meets the specific needs of your assurance case management processes.
