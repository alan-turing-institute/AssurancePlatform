# Frontend Documentation for the TEA Platform

Welcome to the frontend documentation for the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Platform. This section provides comprehensive guides and resources designed to help developers and contributors understand, set up, and customize the frontend aspect of the TEA Platform. Built using the [**React**](https://react.dev/) framework, our frontend architecture aims to deliver a responsive, user-friendly, and accessible interface for creating, managing, and sharing assurance cases.

It encompasses the user interface (UI) design, client-side logic, and interaction with the backend APIs to fetch, display, and manage data dynamically. By leveraging the React framework, the frontend ensures a modular, efficient, and scalable application structure.
