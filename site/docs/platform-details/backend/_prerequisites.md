Before you begin setting up the backend, it's essential to have a proper Python environment management system in place. For this setup, we recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda, which are powerful platforms for managing Python environments and packages. Anaconda is a full-featured distribution that includes a wide range of scientific libraries and tools, making it ideal for data science and machine learning projects. Miniconda is a minimal installer for Anaconda, offering the same environment and package management capabilities but allowing you to install only the packages you need. Both options provide a convenient way to create isolated environments for different projects, ensuring dependencies are kept separate and do not conflict.

If you don't already have [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [**Miniconda**](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installed, please visit their respective websites for installation instructions tailored to your operating system. This will streamline the process of creating a virtual environment and managing the necessary Python packages for the TEA Platform backend.
