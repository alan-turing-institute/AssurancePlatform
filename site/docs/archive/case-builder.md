# An Introduction to the TEA Case Builder

The Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance Platform is dedicated to simplifying the process of creating, managing, and sharing assurance cases. Our Assurance Case Builder is a core feature of the platform, designed to help you visually and logically structure your assurance cases with ease.

By following the steps outlined in this section to add goals, contexts, claims, evidence, and strategies, you can effectively articulate and visualize the ethical assurance of your technology projects.

Remember, a well-constructed assurance case not only supports internal review and decision-making but also enhances trust and transparency with external stakeholders. Used correctly, the Case Builder can be a powerful tool that enables you to methodically demonstrate your technology's compliance with ethical standards.

## Adding Elements

To begin, ensure you're logged into the TEA platform and have selected the assurance case you wish to work on. If you're creating a new case, start by naming your case and providing a brief description.

1. **Adding the Goal Element**. In the Assurance Case Builder interface, start by identifying the top-level goal for your case. Click on the "Add Goal" button to create a new goal.

2. **Define the Goal**. Enter a name and a brief description of your goal. This could be a broad ethical aim like "Ensure Data Privacy" or "Achieve Fairness in AI Decision-Making."

   There's no need for you to save as saving happens automatically in the TEA platform. You can simply move on with the next element.

### Incorporating Contexts

Contexts specify the environment or conditions under which the goal applies.

1. **Select Your Goal**. With your goal created, you can add a context. Click on the goal element to bring up the option to add context.

2. **Add Context**. Click on "Add Context" and fill in the details, such as the operational environment or specific user considerations relevant to your goal.

   Again, there's no need for you to save as saving happens automatically.

### Creating Claims

Claims are specific assertions that support your goal within its context.

1. **Choose a Goal or Strategy**. Select either a goal or a strategy (see below) to which you want to attach a claim.

2. **Add a Claim**. Click on "Add Claim" and provide a concise statement that you plan to justify through evidence. For example, "The system encrypts all user data."

3. **Detail Your Claim**. You may also add a longer description if necessary. Again, your claim will be saved automatically.

### Adding Evidence

Evidence can be anything that supports your claim: test results, expert analysis, or compliance certificates.

1. **Select a Claim**. Navigate to the claim for which you have supporting evidence.

2. **Attach Evidence**. Click "Add Evidence" and describe the evidence that supports your claim.

3. **Link to Documentation (Optional)**. If applicable, you can also provide a URL to where the evidence can be found or reviewed. For transparency and accountability reasons, we encourage you to add a URL, but it's not necessary.

   Again, there's no need for you to save as saving happens automatically.

### Utilizing Strategies (Optional)

For complex assurance cases, you may need to outline strategies that describe how you plan to achieve your goals through a series of claims.

1. **Select a Goal**. Choose the goal for which you want to define a strategy.

2. **Define the Strategy**. Click on "Add Strategy" and enter details about how you intend to structure your argument or the approach to meet the goal.

3. **Create Any Claims**. Create any claims for how you will know that you have successfully accomplished the strategic steps.

4. **Attach Evidence to Strategy Claims**: Link existing evidence (or add new evidence) to your strategy's claims to demonstrate how each contributes to achieving the overarching goal.

## Updating Elements

This is a quick guide on how to update elements such as Goals, Contexts, Claims, and Evidence within the Assurance Case Builder.

Updating elements in the TEA Assurance Case Builder is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that your assurance case remains a dynamic and accurate reflection of your project's commitment to ethical standards.

You should always refine and adjust the details of your assurance case as your project evolves or as new information becomes available.

### Steps to Update Elements

1. **Select the Element**. Navigate to the element you wish to update within your assurance case. Elements can be Goals, Contexts, Claims, or Evidence.

2. **Make Your Changes**. In the editing mode, you can modify any of the element's details, such as its name, description, or associated links. For evidence elements, this may include updating URLs or descriptions to reflect the most current documentation.

There's no need to save your work as the platform will automatically save any changes made.

### Tips for Updating Elements

- **Regularly review your assurance case elements** to ensure they remain accurate and relevant throughout the lifecycle of your project.
- When updating elements, **ensure consistency** in terminology and detail level across your assurance case to facilitate clear understanding and communication.
- Consider keeping a **log of significant updates** for internal records, especially for elements that impact regulatory compliance or critical ethical considerations. <!-- TODO: For discussion with Chris: this might be a feature that we should even add to the project... -->
