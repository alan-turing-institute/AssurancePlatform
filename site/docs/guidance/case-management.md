# Managing TEA Assurance Cases

## Using templates and patterns

Importing templates and patterns can significantly accelerate the development of your assurance cases, providing a solid foundation built on industry best practices. Whether you're new to assurance case development or an experienced practitioner, these resources are designed to enhance the quality and efficacy of your ethical assurance efforts.

This guide is designed to streamline your experience in leveraging pre-defined templates and patterns for creating and managing assurance cases. By importing templates and patterns, you can jumpstart the development of your assurance cases, ensuring you adhere to best practices and standards from the outset.

Templates and patterns are foundational tools within the TEA platform, providing structured outlines that encapsulate best practices for assurance case development. These resources are invaluable for users seeking to ensure their technology projects meet ethical, legal, and social standards.

Templates are pre-designed frameworks for assurance cases that outline the basic structure, including goals, claims, contexts, and evidence placeholders.

Only one template is currently built into the platform: the "Minimal" template. This template contains a pre-organised view featuring a Goal, its Context, and a Claim. This setup serves as an intuitive starting point, guiding users through the initial phases of assurance case development with a clear, manageable structure.

However, if you want to access other templates, you can consult the TEA repository where you will find more worked examples and templates that you can import via the Import File feature <!-- TODO: ADD LINK -->.

### Using the Minimal template

1. Navigate to the Dashboard (make sure you are logged in)
2. If you want to use the built-in template ("Minimal"), click the "Create a new case" button. In the dialog, fill in a Title and a Description, press "Continue". On the next page, select "Minimal" and press "Continue".
3. Your case should now be set up with the minimal template.

### Using a template from the TEA repository

1. Navigate to the <!-- TODO: ADD A PAGE ON DOCS EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENT TEMPLATES --> and select a template. Click on the "Copy URL" button next to the template you want to use.
2. Navigate to the Dashboard (make sure you are logged in)
3. Press the "Import File" button.
4. Press the "URL upload" radio button.
5. Paste the URL you copied from the documentation here. (e.g. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/raw/adding-more-docs/worked-examples/tea-dh/json/5.1.json)
6. Press "Continue"
7. Your template should now have loaded in the Case Builder
