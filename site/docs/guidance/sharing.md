# Sharing TEA Cases

## File formats

The TEA platform enhances collaboration and transparency by enabling users to share assurance cases in versatile formats. Understanding the available file formats for exporting and sharing TEA cases is crucial for effective collaboration.

By leveraging the appropriate file format, you can maximize the impact and utility of your assurance cases, fostering better understanding, collaboration, and engagement among all stakeholders involved in the ethical assurance process.

The platform supports two primary file formats for export: JSON and SVG. Each format serves distinct purposes, catering to different needs for data exchange, visualization, and re-importation into the TEA platform or other compatible systems.

### Formats

| Format | Purpose | Advantage | Use case |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
JSON | The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is designed for data exchange, allowing for the structured representation of the assurance case in a standard, machine-readable format. It is ideal for sharing cases with other systems that accept JSON data or for migrating cases between different deployments of the TEA platform.| JSON files are lightweight and easily parsed by many programming languages, making them suitable for automated processing, data analysis, and integration tasks. Exporting to JSON ensures that all elements of the assurance case, including goals, contexts, claims, and evidence, are preserved in detail. | Ideal for backing up cases, sharing with technical stakeholders, or integrating assurance case data into other software tools and platforms that support JSON.
SVG | The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format provides a visual representation of the assurance case, suitable for presentations, reports, and stakeholder reviews. The SVG files include the data of the case built into the metadata, enabling the visualization to be re-imported into the TEA platform. | SVG files maintain high-quality visual fidelity at any scale, making them perfect for incorporating into documents or presentations that require graphical representation of the assurance case. The embedded case data ensures that the visual representation can be fully integrated back into the TEA platform for further editing or review. | Best suited for sharing the assurance case with non-technical stakeholders, displaying the case structure in documentation, or conducting reviews where a visual overview of the case is beneficial.

### Tips for Sharing Cases

When sharing TEA cases, consider the format that best matches the needs of your audience and the intended use:

**Technical Integration**: Opt for JSON when the case needs to be processed, analyzed, or integrated with other systems.
**Visual Presentation**: Use SVG for stakeholder presentations, documentation, or any scenario where a graphical overview of the case adds value.

Additionally, when sharing cases externally, **ensure that sensitive information is handled** in accordance with your organization's data protection policies and compliance requirements.

## Sharing TEA Cases via GitHub

GitHub, a popular platform for version control and collaboration, is recommended for sharing TEA cases due to its accessibility and ease of use.

By sharing TEA cases via GitHub, you not only benefit from an efficient, collaborative platform but also contribute to the growing body of knowledge around ethical assurance in technology, making it more accessible and impactful.

### Benefits of Using GitHub

Hosting TEA cases on GitHub is not only easy. You can also leverage the platform's robust features for version control, issue tracking, and collaboration, making it an ideal choice for managing and sharing assurance cases with a broader community.

**Version Control**: GitHub provides comprehensive version control features, ensuring changes to assurance cases are tracked, and previous versions are accessible.

**Collaboration**: Invite collaborators to contribute, review, or provide feedback on assurance cases directly within GitHub, fostering a collaborative environment.

**Accessibility**: Hosting your assurance case on a public GitHub repository makes it easily accessible to anyone interested, facilitating knowledge sharing within the TEA community and beyond.

**Permanent Links**: GitHub offers permanent links to specific versions of files, ensuring that references to your assurance cases remain valid and accessible over time.

### How to Share TEA Cases on GitHub

1. **Export Your Case**: Begin by exporting your assurance case from the TEA platform in either JSON or SVG format, depending on your sharing needs. <!-- TODO: [LINK TO EXPORT SECTION] -->
2. **Create a GitHub Repository**: If you don't already have one, create a new repository on GitHub for hosting your TEA cases. Ensure the repository is set to public if you intend to share your case with the wider community.
3. **Upload the Case File**: Upload your exported TEA case file(s) to the GitHub repository. You can organize multiple cases within the same repository using folders.
4. **Share the Link**: Once uploaded, you can share the link to your repository or specific files within it. For JSON files intended for import into TEA, ensure the URL points directly to the raw version of the file.

### Best Practices for Sharing on GitHub

**Documentation**: Include a README file in your repository with information about the assurance cases, how to use them, and any relevant context or instructions for collaborators. <!-- TODO: [DOES TTW HAVE SOME INFO HERE?] -->

**Licensing**: Consider adding a license file to your repository to clearly communicate how others can use or contribute to your assurance cases. <!-- TODO: [LINK TO TTW HERE] -->

**Engage with the Community**: Use issues and pull requests to engage with users who may have questions, suggestions, or contributions to your assurance cases.
