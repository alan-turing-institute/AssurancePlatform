    This section is being drafted.

In this section you will find the main documentation and user guidance for the TEA platform.
For those who are completely new to the platform, we recommend you follow these guides in order <!-- (or watch our [introductory video]()) -->:

1. Getting started with the TEA platform (*in progress*)
2. Building an assurance case (*in progress*)
3. [Components of an assurance case](components.md)
4. Managing and sharing assurance cases (*in progress*)

You can also find more advanced documentation (e.g. deployment instructions, API documentation) in our [platform details](../platform-details/about.md) section.
