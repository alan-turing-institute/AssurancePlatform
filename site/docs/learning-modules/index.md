In this section you will find a series of learning modules, designed to help you understand how to use the TEA platform.
These resources include explanations of the underlying methodology, guides to using the online tool, getting the most out of our community resources, and more.

Some of the content can be read in any order and independently of each other, but for those who are completely new to Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance, a more structured curriculum has been developed.
