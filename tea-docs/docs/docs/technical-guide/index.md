Our technology stack ensures that the TEA platform is not only powerful and reliable but also accessible to users with different levels of technical expertise.

The TEA Platform is a full-stack application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework known for its fast and modern approach to building interactive web applications. The platform uses [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) for database management, providing type-safe database access and migrations.

Data is stored in [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), providing a robust and scalable storage solution. The platform supports easy installation and deployment through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), making it straightforward to set up in various environments, including [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us).
