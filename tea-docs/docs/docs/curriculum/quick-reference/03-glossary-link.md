* **[Assurance Case](../shared/glossary.md#assurance-case)** - Structured argument demonstrating a system meets its goals
* **[Argument](../shared/glossary.md#argument)** - Logical structure linking claims to evidence
* **[Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA)](../shared/glossary.md#trustworthy-and-ethical-assurance-tea)** - The methodology and platform for argument-based assurance

### Element Types

* **[Property Claim](../shared/glossary.md#property-claim)** - Specific claim about a system property
* **[Strategy](../shared/glossary.md#strategy)** - Explanation of how goals/claims are decomposed
* **[Evidence](../shared/glossary.md#evidence)** - Information supporting claims
* **[Context](../shared/glossary.md#context)** - Scope, boundaries, and constraints

### Evidence & Quality

* **[Evidence Quality](../shared/glossary.md#evidence-quality)** - Assessment of evidence using three criteria: relevance, reliability, sufficiency
* **[Relevance](../shared/glossary.md#relevance)** - How directly evidence supports a claim
* **[Reliability](../shared/glossary.md#reliability)** - How trustworthy the evidence source is
* **[Sufficiency](../shared/glossary.md#sufficiency)** - Whether there's enough evidence to support the claim

### Methodology
