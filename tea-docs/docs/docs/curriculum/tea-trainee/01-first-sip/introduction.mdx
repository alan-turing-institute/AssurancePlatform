# Module Introduction

Imagine you're about to use a new AI system that screens job applications at your company. The vendor claims it's "fair and unbiased".

How can you be sure that the vendor's claim is true? What reasoning has been provided to assure you that it won't discriminate against certain groups? What evidence would convince you?

In this module, you'll explore an approach to answering these questions known as **Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance** (or TEA for short). But rather than starting with definitions and theory, let's dive straight into a real example.
