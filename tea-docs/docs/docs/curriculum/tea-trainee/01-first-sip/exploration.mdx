# Exploration: Your First TEA Case

The best way to learn about assurance cases is to experience one first-hand. Rather than starting with definitions and theory, you'll dive straight into exploring a real example.

Below, you'll interact with a Fair Recruitment AI assurance case. You'll be guided through the structure with specific tasks, helping you discover how structured arguments build trust. This is a simple example of how organisations would demonstrate their AI systems are trustworthy using the TEA platform.

Click on different elements in the case to understand how the argument flows from a high-level claim down to concrete evidence. **Follow the guided tasks that appear in the progress tracker at the bottom-right.**

<CaseViewerWrapper
  caseFile="fair-recruitment-ai.json"
  showAllNodes={false}
  enableExploration={true}
/>

## Independent Exploration

<TaskCheckpoint
  id="explore-connections"
  showHeader={false}
  showButton={true}
  buttonPosition="bottom"
>

Now that you've been guided through the structure, explore freely. Click "Reveal All" to see the complete argument at once.

### Discovery Questions

As you explore, consider:

* What makes this argument convincing (or not)?
* Are there any claims that seem weak or unsupported?
* How does breaking down "fairness" into smaller parts help?
* Would you trust this AI system based on this case?

Take your time to click through the different elements and understand their relationships. When you feel you've explored thoroughly, mark this task as complete below.

### Understanding the Elements

Navigate through each concept to understand what role it plays in the assurance case. Use the arrows or keyboard to move between concepts:
