# Enhanced React Flow Components Demo

This page demonstrates the enhanced React Flow components with advanced editing capabilities. You can interact with the assurance case diagram using various features.

## Interactive Features

### 🖱️ Mouse Interactions
- **Double-click** on empty canvas to create new nodes
- **Right-click** on nodes for context menus (edit, delete, duplicate)
- **Right-click** on edges for connection options
- **Click** on nodes to select and reveal connected nodes

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Delete**: Remove selected node
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo last action
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Redo
- **Escape**: Close dialogs/menus

### 🎨 Visual Features
- **Collapsible nodes**: Click expand/collapse indicators
- **Glassmorphism styling**: Modern dark theme with blur effects
- **Animated edges**: Smooth connection animations
- **Auto Layout**: Arrange nodes hierarchically

## Test Assurance Case

Below is an interactive assurance case for testing. Feel free to modify it by adding, editing, or removing nodes.

<CaseViewerWrapper
  caseFile="test-case.json"
  showAllNodes={false}
  enableExploration={true}
  useEnhanced={true}
/>

## Usage Instructions

### Creating Nodes
1. **Double-click** anywhere on the empty canvas
2. A **Node Type Selector** dialog will appear
3. Choose from: Goal, Strategy, Property Claim, Evidence, or Context
4. Fill in the node details (optional)
5. Click "Create" to add the node

### Editing Nodes
1. **Right-click** on any node
2. Select "Edit" from the context menu
3. Modify the node properties in the dialog
4. Click "Save" to apply changes

### Managing Connections
1. Drag from a node's handle (+ decorator) to another node
2. Right-click on connections to modify or delete them
3. Use the context menu to change connection styles

### Layout Options
- **Reveal All**: Show all hidden nodes at once
- **Reset**: Return to initial view with only top-level nodes
- **Auto Layout**: Automatically arrange nodes with proper spacing
- **Fit View**: Zoom to fit all visible nodes

## Node Types

### 🎯 Goal
The top-level claim or objective that needs to be assured. Goals are shown in green with a target icon.

### 🌿 Strategy
The approach or method used to support a goal or break it down. Strategies are purple with a branch icon.

### 📄 Property Claim
A specific claim that supports the strategy. Property claims are orange with a document icon.

### ✅ Evidence
Concrete proof or documentation that supports claims. Evidence nodes are cyan with a check icon.

### ℹ️ Context
Additional information that provides scope or constraints. Context nodes are gray with an info icon.

## Tips
- Use **Auto Layout** after creating multiple nodes to organize them
- **Collapse nodes** to reduce clutter and focus on specific areas
- **Export** your assurance case as an image using the context menu
- The **minimap** in the corner helps navigate large diagrams

## Feedback
This is a demonstration of the enhanced React Flow components. The editing features are designed to make creating and managing assurance cases more intuitive and efficient.
