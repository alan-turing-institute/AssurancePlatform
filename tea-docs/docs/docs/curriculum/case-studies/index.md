# Case Studies

This collection contains case studies designed for hands-on activities. Each case study describes a realistic AI/ML system scenario for which participants will develop an assurance case.

## Available Case Studies

### Fairness-Focused

| Case Study | Domain | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| [Equitable Flood Risk Assessment](./flood-risk-assessment.md) | Environmental Science | An AI system for assessing flood risk across communities |
| [Fair Crop Damage Assessment](./crop-damage-assessment.md) | Agricultural Finance | An AI system for evaluating crop insurance claims |

### Explainability-Focused

| Case Study | Domain | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| [Explainable Diabetic Retinopathy Screening](./diabetic-retinopathy-screening.md) | Healthcare | An AI system for screening retinal images |
| [Explainable Student Learning Assessment](./student-learning-assessment.md) | Education | An AI system for identifying student learning gaps |

## How to Use These Case Studies

1. **Read the case study** to understand the system, stakeholders, and context
2. **Identify the top-level goal** based on the assurance focus (fairness or explainability)
3. **Develop strategies** to decompose the goal into demonstrable sub-objectives
4. **Create property claims** that make specific, testable assertions
5. **Identify evidence** that would support each claim

## Case Study Structure

Each case study follows a consistent format:

- **Overview**: Brief summary of the system and its purpose
- **System Description**: Detailed explanation of how the AI system works
- **Stakeholders**: Who is affected by or involved with the system
- **Regulatory Context**: Relevant laws, standards, and guidelines
- **Key Technical Details**: Model type, data sources, deployment context
- **Assurance Focus**: The specific trustworthy AI property to be assured
- **Suggested Starting Points**: Initial ideas for structuring the assurance case
