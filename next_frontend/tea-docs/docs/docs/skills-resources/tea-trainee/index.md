2. **Brewing Your Own TEA**: a walkthrough of the TEA platform, showing new users how to build an assurance case.
3. **Letting the TEA Steep**: a deeper dive into the process of building an assurance case, with an emphasis on reflection, deliberation, and justification.
4. **Drinking TEA with Others**: getting more from the TEA platform by collaborating and sharing knowledge with the rest of the community and wider assurance ecosystem.
