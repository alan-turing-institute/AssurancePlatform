# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful open-source React framework developed by Vercel (formerly Zeit) that enables developers to build server-rendered React applications with ease. Released in 2016, Next.js has rapidly gained popularity in the web development community due to its ability to simplify complex tasks and enhance performance, scalability, and developer experience.

## Getting Started with Next.js
To start using Next.js, you can follow these basic steps:

Installation:

```bash
Copy code
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

### Directory Structure:

`app/`: Contains React components that define routes.
`public/`: Stores static assets like images and fonts.
`app/global.css`: Includes global and component-specific styles.

### Creating Pages:

Add a new file in the `app/` directory, e.g., about.js, to create an `/about` route.

### API Routes:

Create files in `app/api/` to define backend endpoints, such as `/api/users.js`.
