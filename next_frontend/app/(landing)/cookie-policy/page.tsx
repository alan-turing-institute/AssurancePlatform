            Third-Party Cookies
          </h2>

            If you choose to authenticate using a third-party provider (e.g., GitHub), that provider will set its own cookies as part of their authentication process. These cookies are governed by the respective third-party's cookie policy, which you should review. The TEA Platform does not control these third-party cookies once you are on their domain for authentication.
