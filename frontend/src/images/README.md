# Images and Icons

## Core Line

Fruto have provided icons from the [Core Line set](https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/core-line) that they have a licence for.

These icons have been modified to replace all instances of a set stroke or fill colour with `currentColor` in order to let them be styled by css.
