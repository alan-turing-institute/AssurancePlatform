## About this Repository 🗂

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Trustworthy and
Ethical Assurance (TEA) platform—an application for building trustworthy and
ethical assurance cases, developed by researchers at the
[Alan Turing Institute](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-4ZW65bL-AhXJMMAKHfeGCJ8QFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.turing.ac.uk%2F&usg=AOvVaw0uxvZzQpCGw78bVsaCsSOm)
and [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/).

The UK's Responsible Technology Adoption Unit (Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology) is also a project partner.

To use the TEA platform, please go to [https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/).

> [!WARNING]
> The TEA platform is made available as a research preview, and should not be used for any business critical tasks. Future breaking changes should be expected.

## What is Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance? 🤝

> Trustworthy and ethical assurance is a methodology and procedure for
> developing a structured argument, which provides reviewable (and contestable)
> assurance that a set of claims about a normative goal of a data-driven
> technology are warranted given the available evidence.

The following elements are central to this methodology and procedure:

- **The SAFE-D Principles**: a set of five operationalisable
  principles—Sustainability, Accountability, Fairness, Explainability, Data
  Stewardship—that have been carefully designed and refined to address
  real-world challenges associated with the design, development, and deployment
  of data-driven technologies.
- **Assurance Cases**: the documented argument that communicates the basis for
  how and why a goal has been achieved.
- **Argument Patterns**: starting templates for building assurance cases. They
  identify the types of claims (or, the sets of reasons) that need to be
  established to justify the associated top-level normative goal.

The Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance platform brings these elements together in
a usable and accessible manner, and helps project teams to provide trustworthy
and justifiable assurance about the processes they undertook when designing,
developing, and deploying their technology or system.

## Installation Instructions 💻
