## About this Repository ðŸ—‚

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Trustworthy and
Ethical Assurance (TEA) platformâ€”an application for building trustworthy and
ethical assurance cases, developed by researchers at the
[Alan Turing Institute](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-4ZW65bL-AhXJMMAKHfeGCJ8QFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.turing.ac.uk%2F&usg=AOvVaw0uxvZzQpCGw78bVsaCsSOm)
and [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/).

The UK's Responsible Technology Adoption Unit (Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology) is also a project partner.

## Usage and Deployment Instructions ðŸ’»

### 1 Use the TEA Platorm

If you'd like to just use the TEA platform, and have some familiarity with building assurance cases already, please go to [https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/).

> [!WARNING]
> The TEA platform is made available as a **research preview**, and should not be used for any business critical tasks. Future breaking changes should be expected.

### 2 Learn About TEA

If you are not sure what an assurance case is, or need some help using the platform, please view our documentation site at
[https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AssurancePlatform](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AssurancePlatform).

### 3 Run Locally

The TEA application can be run locally or deployed on your own server or a cloud-based service (e.g. Azure). You can find the instructions on how to do this here: [https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AssurancePlatform/technical-documentation/local-quickstart/](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AssurancePlatform/technical-documentation/local-quickstart/)
