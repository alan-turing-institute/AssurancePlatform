<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-standards">What are standards?<a href="#what-are-standards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are standards?" title="Direct link to What are standards?">​</a></h2>
<p>A &#x27;standard&#x27; can be described as rules, norms or guidelines, that are established for application within certain contexts and settings. They are crafted to establish a dependable foundation for cultivating collective expectations concerning a product, process, service, or system as part of governance and assurance frameworks. We see examples of their implementation in industry, academia, professions, product development and service delivery.</p>
<p>Standards are developed in a variety of ways, although the best-practice approach to their formation and the most widely accepted are essentially standards crafted through <em>consensus-building processes</em>.
These standards can be developed and led by, for example, academic institutions, international bodies, professional associations, industry, or most commonly, formally recognised Standards Development Organisations (SDOs).<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-sdos" id="user-content-fnref-sdos" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Standards developed by SDOs are often referred to as &#x27;technical standards&#x27;.
These standards are developed by stakeholder-driven processes that are guided by principles such as relevance, transparency, and consensus.
Standards on the whole are voluntary but can be formally recognised in regulations and international treaties, especially those developed by SDOs.
Furthermore, they can be tools used as part of compliance towards governance and assurance frameworks.</p>
<p>Standards can be in a variety of forms but commonly are established and disseminated as documents approved by a recognised body.
They provide common and repeatable rules, requirements, norms, guidelines and characteristics for activities that will lead to their associated outcomes; and are aimed at providing &#x27;optimum degree of order&#x27;<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-iso" id="user-content-fnref-iso" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> in the contexts where they are applied.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="different-types-of-standards">Different types of standards<a href="#different-types-of-standards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Different types of standards" title="Direct link to Different types of standards">​</a></h2>
<p>Standards find application across diverse domains and sectors.
They serve to encode technical specifications related to the design, development, measurement, or performance; of products and systems.
Additionally, standards extend their influence to evaluating the impacts or efficiency of broader processes or services.</p>
<p>While some standards are uncomplicated, offering clear metric definitions (e.g. the standardised format of A4 and related paper sizes adopted globally), others offer guidance on intricate, context-specific processes.</p>
<p>Below are some of the categories of standards available.</p>

<p>Foundational and terminological standards provide shared vocabularies, terms, concepts, descriptions and definitions, enabling effective communication and fostering collaboration between stakeholders on a given shared area of interest.
They help improve understanding between stakeholders through the shared common language at their disposal by setting out agreed-upon terms and definitions.
These standards often form the baseline language utilised in other standards supporting their development and forming bilateral relationships.</p>

<p>Standards, as functional tools, can play a pivotal role in realising a wide array of benefits across many domains and sectors.
They ensure consistency and uniformity; provide a common language and set of guidelines for processes, products, or services; and help to systematically manage risks and unlock potential.
This consistency enhances communication, reduces misunderstandings, creates trust and fosters a shared understanding among stakeholders.
They are increasingly relied upon when implementing assurance frameworks to provide the specificity required to assure the quality and safety.
This leads to increased efficiency and innovative edge to stay current and competitive in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>The following headings highlight the functions and benefits in more detail:</p>

<p>The paramount concern for organisations engaged in technology production is the safety and quality of their products.
This concern extends to the individuals who adopt, use, and are affected by these technologies.
Standards serve as a cornerstone, enabling organisations to attain high-quality products and effectively manage associated risks by integrating them into their assurance systems.
These standards become integral components of conformity assessments, allowing organisations to demonstrate that their technologies and services not only meet safety, ethical, and legal requirements but also contribute to enhancing their reputation and fostering public trust.
Noteworthy examples like <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/digital-clinical-safety-assurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DCB 0129/0160</a> exemplify how standards, such as those integrated into the clinical safety assurance framework of the NHS in England, play a pivotal role in upholding safety standards and ensuring the quality of technologies within the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>By establishing benchmarks for the quality of products, services, or processes, standards help organisations maintain high standards of excellence.
Consumers, in turn, gain confidence in products that adhere to recognised standards, knowing that they meet specified criteria for safety, reliability, and performance.
Additionally, standards contribute to cost savings and efficiency by streamlining processes, reducing errors, and optimising resource utilisation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="knowledge-and-technology-diffusion">Knowledge and technology diffusion<a href="#knowledge-and-technology-diffusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Knowledge and technology diffusion" title="Direct link to Knowledge and technology diffusion">​</a></h3>
<p>Standards and their development processes provide an infrastructure for the transfer of knowledge and technology within society and the economy.
The consensus-building processes inherent in standards development are particularly noteworthy, as they facilitate the translation of research and best practices into accessible, practical guidance.
Furthermore, through these consensus-building processes, standards development forums bring together experts, stakeholders, and representatives from various sectors.
This collaborative effort ensures that a broad spectrum of perspectives is considered, leading to the creation of standards that reflect a shared understanding of best practices.
As a result, organisations can leverage these standards to enhance their operational processes and bring products to market that demonstrate trustworthy properties.</p>
<p>By bridging the gap between research and practical application, standards become instrumental in driving improvements in operational efficiency and the overall quality of products entering the commercial sphere.
They provide a structured pathway for the integration of advancements from diverse fields into the fabric of everyday operations, ultimately contributing to the advancement of technology, innovation, and the betterment of society and the economy at large.</p>

<p>Certain standards are explicitly endorsed by regulatory authorities as essential tools for organisations to meet the requirements outlined in regulations.
In the UKs regulatory framework, relevant Secretaries of State have the authority to &#x27;designate&#x27; specific standards for the purpose of regulatory conformity.
When a standard is officially designated by the government, its adoption carries a significant weight—it essentially presumes that organisations adhering to this standard are in compliance with the pertinent aspects of regional regulations.
In essence, organisations that have followed a designated standard are presumed to be in compliant with the relevant regulatory requirements.
This mechanism mirrors similar practices in other jurisdictions, such as the European Union (EU), where &#x27;harmonised&#x27; standards play an analogous role in establishing and ensuring regulatory conformity.</p>

<p>Using the types of standards as a reference, we can identify the following roles for standards in the TEA framework:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-ecosystem" id="user-content-fnref-ecosystem" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="supporting-development-of-assurance-case-structure">Supporting development of assurance case structure<a href="#supporting-development-of-assurance-case-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Supporting development of assurance case structure" title="Direct link to Supporting development of assurance case structure">​</a></h3>
<p>Several types of standards can support the development of an assurance case&#x27;s structure.
For instance, <code>foundational and terminological</code> standards can be useful for identifying core attributes for a top-level goal claim, which in turn would allow a project team to develop strategies for each of the core attributes.
And, <code>process, management, and governance</code> standards could help a team or organisation develop a project governance plan that integrates considerations of the iterative development of an assurance case (e.g. ML safety requirements as set out in the AMLAS guidance<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-amlas" id="user-content-fnref-amlas" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>).
These standards can also ensure that the assurance case adheres to industry best practices, thereby enhancing its credibility and acceptance.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evidential-grounding-and-justification-of-property-claims">Evidential grounding and justification of property claims<a href="#evidential-grounding-and-justification-of-property-claims" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evidential grounding and justification of property claims" title="Direct link to Evidential grounding and justification of property claims">​</a></h3>
<p>Property claims require evidential grounding.
That is, the validity of a claim needs to be justified by connecting the claim to evidence through a <code>supported by</code> link (see <a href="/documentation/docs/skills-resources/tea-trainee/first-sip">guidance</a>).
But how does a project team or organisation know which evidence to select, and whether it is sufficient to justify the claims being made? This is where standards can provide useful support?</p>
<p>For instance, <code>measurement and test methods</code> and <code>product and performance requirements</code> standards are crucial for determining whether a system meets the required performance levels.
They can also help set out criteria or benchmarks for determining which forms of evidence are sufficient (e.g. objective and quantitative criteria for compliance) or how the evidence should be gathered, documented, and managed (e.g. communication of uncertainty when dealing with probabilistic evidence).</p>

<li>When splitting a collected data set into training, validation, and testing datasets, make sure each of them is randomly selected by applying certain techniques (e.g., data shuffling with a random number generator). By doing so, it can reduce the potential bias introduced in this process.</li>

<p>For systems that interact with other systems or operate within a larger ecosystem, <code>process, management, and governance</code> standards can ensure compatibility or interoperability of data.
This can be vital in situations where groups of stakeholders are making choice about whether to invest or interact with a specific ecosystem or platform (e.g. digital twins).
Here, providing assurance (through reference to an accepted standard) can build confidence among the stakeholders (or possible stakeholders) within the ecosystem.
Such an example extends beyond goals such as interoperability though.
Concerns such as data quality, security and privacy, liability and accountability, can also impact the trustworthiness of a system.
As such, communication through structured assurance cases that reference key standards can help build trust.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="knowledge-transfer-and-consensus-formation">Knowledge transfer and consensus formation<a href="#knowledge-transfer-and-consensus-formation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Knowledge transfer and consensus formation" title="Direct link to Knowledge transfer and consensus formation">​</a></h4>
<p>Where standards exist at an early (and perhaps incomplete) stage of development, or perhaps do not exist at all (e.g. when dealing with novel data-driven technologies), assurance cases can serve as a useful reference for how different teams and sectors understand sufficiency and justifiability.
Consider a situation where an assurance claim regarding a property of a system cannot be sufficiently evidenced.
This does not necessarily mean it is false.
Rather, it could indicate a gap where standards do not yet exist.
In this sense, open assurance cases can support the formation of consensus and the development of best practices and community-based standards.</p>
<p>For instance, several teams within a shared community of practice (e.g. explainability of AI systems for environmental science) may choose to share their assurance cases with each other through structured knowledge share events (e.g. workshops). In doing so, they could identify common claims that depend on the same forms of <code>evaluative</code> evidence (e.g. usability testing and related human factors research). Furthermore, they may be able to identify areas where their design choices will limit <code>interoperability</code> in the broader ecosystem, and on this basis revisit their system requirements.</p>
