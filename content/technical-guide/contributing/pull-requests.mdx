## What We Welcome

### Bug Fixes

Found a bug? We appreciate bug fix contributions:

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/issues) to see if it's already reported
- If not, create a new issue describing the bug
- Reference the issue number in your PR

### Documentation Improvements

Help us improve the documentation:

- Fix typos, clarify explanations
- Add missing documentation
- Improve code examples

### Feature Contributions

New features should align with the platform's goals:

- Discuss the feature in a GitHub issue first
- Get maintainer feedback before significant work
- Consider impact on existing users

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is always welcome:

- Unit tests for utilities and helpers
- Integration tests for Server Actions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Getting Started

### 1. Find an Issue

Browse issues labelled:
- `good first issue` - Suitable for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Maintainers would appreciate help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### 2. Fork and Clone

```shell
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AssurancePlatform.git
cd AssurancePlatform
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the [Docker Quickstart](/technical-guide/getting-started/docker-quickstart) or [Local Development](/technical-guide/getting-started/local-development) guide.

### 4. Create a Branch

Use descriptive branch names:

```shell
# For features
git checkout -b feature/add-export-functionality

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/login-redirect-issue

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/improve-api-reference
```

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Code Style Guide](./code-style)

### 6. Run Quality Checks

Before submitting, ensure all checks pass:

```shell
# Lint and format
pnpm exec ultracite check

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

pnpm run test
```

### 7. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve login redirect issue on expired sessions"
```

Commit message guidelines:
- Start with a type: `Fix:`, `Feature:`, `Docs:`, `Refactor:`, `Test:`
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues: `Fixes #123`

```shell
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- Description of what and why
- Link to related issue(s)
- Screenshots for UI changes
