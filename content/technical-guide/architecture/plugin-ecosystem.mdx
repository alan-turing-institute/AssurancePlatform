# Plugin Ecosystem

<Callout type="warning">
**Coming Soon**

The plugin ecosystem is planned for a future release. This page outlines the vision for extensibility in the TEA Platform.
</Callout>

## Vision

The TEA Platform aims to support a plugin architecture that allows the community to extend functionality without modifying the core codebase. This will enable:

- **Custom element types** - Domain-specific argument elements
- **Import/export formats** - Support for various assurance case standards
- **Analysis tools** - Automated checking and validation
- **Integrations** - Connections to external tools and data sources

## Planned Plugin Types

### Element Type Plugins

Allow definition of custom element types beyond the standard GSN notation:

- Custom shapes and styling
- Additional metadata fields
- Validation rules

### Format Plugins

Support for importing and exporting assurance cases in various formats:

- GSN Community Standard XML
- SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel)
- Arm's SCSC format
- Custom organisational formats

### Analysis Plugins

Tools for analysing and validating assurance cases:

- Completeness checking
- Pattern matching
- Confidence assessment
- Regulatory compliance checking

### Integration Plugins

Connections to external systems:

- Version control integration
- Requirements management tools
- Test management systems
- Document repositories

## Contributing

2. Review open issues tagged with `plugin-system`
3. Share your use cases and requirements

## Timeline

The plugin ecosystem is planned for development after the core platform reaches v1.0 stability. Check the [changelog](/technical-guide/ci-cd-pipeline/changelog) for updates on progress.
