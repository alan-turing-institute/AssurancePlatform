# TEA Skills and Capabilities Resources

These resources include explanations of the underlying methodology, guides to using the online tool, and more.

Some of the content can be read in any order and independently of each other, but for those who are completely new to Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance, a more structured curriculum has been developed.
