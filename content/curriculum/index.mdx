# TEA Skills and Capabilities Resources

In this section you will find a series of skills and capabilities resources, designed to help you understand more about TEA and how to use the TEA platform. These resources include explanations of the underlying methodology, guides to using the online tool, and more.

Some of the content can be read in any order and independently of each other, but for those who are completely new to Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance, a more structured curriculum has been developed.
