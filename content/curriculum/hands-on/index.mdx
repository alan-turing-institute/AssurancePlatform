# Hands-On Resources

Welcome to the hands-on resources section of the TEA curriculum. This section provides practical materials for applying what you've learned about trustworthy and ethical assurance.

## What's Available

### Case Studies

Real-world examples demonstrating TEA methodology in practice:

- **[Case Studies](./case-studies/)** - Explore assurance cases from healthcare, agriculture, environment, and education domains

## Coming Soon

We're actively developing additional hands-on resources:

- **Interactive Workshops** - Guided activities for building assurance cases
- **Exercise Sets** - Practice problems with solutions
- **Assessment Tools** - Self-evaluation checklists and rubrics

## How to Use These Resources

These hands-on materials are designed to complement the structured curriculum:

1. **After completing modules** - Apply concepts from TEA Trainee, Specialist, or Expert levels
2. **In workshops** - Use case studies for group discussions and activities
3. **For self-study** - Work through examples to reinforce learning
4. **As templates** - Adapt case studies for your own projects
