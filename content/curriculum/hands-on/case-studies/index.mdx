# Case Studies

Explore real-world examples of assurance cases across different domains. These case studies demonstrate how the TEA methodology can be applied to various AI and data-driven systems.

## Available Case Studies

| Case Study | Domain | Assurance Goal |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| [Diabetic Retinopathy Screening](./diabetic-retinopathy-screening) | Healthcare | Explainability |
| [Crop Damage Assessment](./crop-damage-assessment) | Agriculture | Fairness |
| [Flood Risk Assessment](./flood-risk-assessment) | Environmental | Fairness |
| [Student Learning Assessment](./student-learning-assessment) | Education | Explainability |
| [Transparent Clinical GenAI System with Legacy Data](./clinical-genai-data-governance) | Healthcare | Transparency |
| [Equitable Personalised Pharmaceutical Formulation System](./personalised-pharmaceutical-formulations) | Pharmaceutical | Fairness |

### Healthcare

- **[Diabetic Retinopathy Screening](./diabetic-retinopathy-screening)** - An AI system for detecting diabetic retinopathy in retinal images
- **[Transparent Clinical GenAI System with Legacy Data](./clinical-genai-data-governance)** - A GenAI clinical decision support system trained on patient data collected under historical consent frameworks

### Pharmaceutical

- **[Equitable Personalised Pharmaceutical Formulation System](./personalised-pharmaceutical-formulations)** - AI-powered personalised drug formulations with fairness considerations for demographically biased training data

### Agriculture

- **[Crop Damage Assessment](./crop-damage-assessment)** - Using satellite imagery and ML for agricultural damage assessment

### Environmental

- **[Flood Risk Assessment](./flood-risk-assessment)** - AI-powered flood risk prediction and management

### Education

- **[Student Learning Assessment](./student-learning-assessment)** - AI systems for educational assessment and feedback

## How to Use These Case Studies

Each case study includes:

1. **Overview** - Background on the domain and system being assessed
2. **System Description** - Technical details of the AI system
3. **Stakeholders** - Key parties with interests in the system's assurance
4. **Regulatory Context** - Relevant regulations and standards
5. **Assurance Considerations** - Specific concerns for the assurance goal (e.g., fairness, explainability, transparency)
6. **Deliberative Prompts** - Questions for reflection and discussion
7. **Suggested Strategies** - Approaches for developing the assurance case
8. **Recommended Techniques** - Links to relevant TEA Techniques for gathering evidence

These case studies can be used for:

- **Self-study** - Work through examples at your own pace
- **Workshops** - Group activities and discussions
- **Templates** - Starting points for your own assurance cases
