# TEA Platform Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the TEA Platform and curriculum.

## A

### Argument

A logical structure that links claims to evidence, showing how evidence supports the claims being made. In the TEA context, arguments are structured using goals, strategies, property claims, evidence, and context elements.

### Assurance

The process of building justified trust in a system through structured argumentation and evidence. Assurance involves demonstrating that a system meets its stated goals and requirements.

### Assurance Case

A structured argument, supported by evidence, that provides a compelling and demonstrable case that a system satisfies its stated properties. An assurance case typically includes goals, strategies, claims, evidence, and context.

## C

### Claim

A statement that something is true about a system. In TEA, claims can be goal claims (top-level normative statements) or property claims (specific testable statements about system properties).

### Context

Information that defines the scope, boundaries, and assumptions under which an assurance case applies. Context elements help readers understand the conditions under which claims are valid.

### Critical Reflection

The systematic examination of assumptions, reasoning, and evidence within an assurance case. Critical reflection helps identify weaknesses, biases, and areas for improvement.

## D

### Deliberation

Careful consideration of different perspectives, options, and trade-offs when developing an assurance case. Deliberation involves engaging with diverse stakeholders and viewpoints.

## E

### Evidence

Information that supports claims in an assurance case. Evidence can be technical (test results, metrics), process-based (audits, certifications), stakeholder-derived (surveys, interviews), or based on standards compliance.

### Evidence Quality

The assessment of evidence based on three criteria: relevance (how directly it supports the claim), reliability (how trustworthy the source is), and sufficiency (whether there's enough evidence).

## G

### Goal Claim

The top-level normative claim in an assurance case that directs the entire argument structure. Goal claims state what the assurance case aims to demonstrate about the system.

## J

### Justified Trust

Trust that is based on evidence and reasoning, rather than blind faith or assumption. The TEA approach aims to build justified trust through structured argumentation.

## P

### Property Claim

A specific, testable claim about a property of the system being assured. Property claims support goal claims and are themselves supported by evidence.

## R

### Relevance

One of three evidence quality criteria. Relevance assesses how directly the evidence supports the specific claim it's linked to.

### Reliability

One of three evidence quality criteria. Reliability assesses how trustworthy and credible the evidence source is.

## S

### Stakeholder

Anyone with an interest in or affected by the system being assured. Stakeholders may include users, developers, regulators, affected communities, and others.

### Strategy

An element in an assurance case that explains how a goal or claim is decomposed into sub-claims. Strategies make the reasoning behind the argument structure explicit.

### Sufficiency

One of three evidence quality criteria. Sufficiency assesses whether there is enough evidence to adequately support the claim.

## T

### Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA)

The methodology and platform for developing argument-based assurance cases that demonstrate systems are trustworthy and ethically designed, developed, and deployed.
