# Assessment: Check Your Understanding

## Quick Knowledge Check

Let's quickly check your understanding of the key concepts:

<MultipleChoiceQuiz
  questions={[
    {
      id: "q1",
      question:
        "In the Fair Recruitment AI case, what was the top-level goal trying to establish?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "The system is fast and efficient" },
        {
          id: "b",
          text: "The system makes fair and unbiased hiring recommendations",
        },
        { id: "c", text: "The system is cost-effective" },
        { id: "d", text: "The system is easy to use" },
      ],
      correctAnswer: "b",
      explanation:
        "The main goal explicitly states that the AI recruitment system makes fair and unbiased hiring recommendations.",
    },
    {
      id: "q2",
      question: "What role do strategies play in an assurance case?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "They provide evidence" },
        { id: "b", text: "They define the context" },
        {
          id: "c",
          text: "They break down complex goals into manageable arguments",
        },
        { id: "d", text: "They state the main claim" },
      ],
      correctAnswer: "c",
      explanation:
        "Strategies describe the approach used to argue that a goal is satisfied by breaking it into smaller parts.",
    },
    {
      id: "q3",
      question: "Why is evidence important in an assurance case?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "It makes the case look professional" },
        {
          id: "b",
          text: "It provides concrete proof that supports the claims",
        },
        { id: "c", text: "It defines the scope of the argument" },
        { id: "d", text: "It connects different strategies" },
      ],
      correctAnswer: "b",
      explanation:
        "Evidence provides the concrete facts, test results, or documentation that grounds the argument in reality.",
    },
  ]}

  useGlobalProgress={true}
  passThreshold={60}

### True or False?

<TrueFalseQuiz
  statements={[
    {
      id: "tf1",
      statement:
        "An assurance case starts with evidence and builds up to a goal.",
      correct: false,
      explanation:
        "Assurance cases start with a top-level goal and decompose it down to evidence.",
    },
    {
      id: "tf2",
      statement:
        "Context elements help define the boundaries and assumptions of the case.",
      correct: true,
      explanation:
        "Context explicitly states the scope, assumptions, and conditions under which the goal is claimed to be satisfied.",
    },
    {
      id: "tf3",
      statement: "Property claims must be specific and measurable.",
      correct: true,
      explanation:
        "Property claims represent concrete, verifiable statements that can be supported by evidence.",
    },
  ]}

/>
