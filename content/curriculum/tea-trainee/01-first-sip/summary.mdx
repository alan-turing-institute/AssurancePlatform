# Module Summary

Congratulations! You've completed your first exploration of an assurance case. Let's recap what you've discovered.

## What You've Learned

Through hands-on exploration and reflection, you've experienced:

### The Core Elements

You encountered five types of elements in the Fair Recruitment AI case:

1. **Goal** (Green) - The main claim: "The AI recruitment system makes fair and unbiased hiring recommendations"
2. **Strategies** (Purple) - Three approaches to argue fairness: bias detection, transparency, and monitoring
3. **Property Claims** (Orange) - Specific, measurable statements like "Training data has been audited"
4. **Evidence** (Cyan) - Concrete proof like audit reports and statistical analyses
5. **Context** (Grey) - Boundaries and definitions, like what "fairness" means legally

### The Key Insight

An assurance case works by **decomposing** a big claim (like "our AI is fair") into smaller, more manageable claims, and then providing evidence for each small claim. It's like building a pyramid of trust, where each level supports the one above it.

> **The Power of Decomposition**
>
> Breaking down complex claims into smaller, evidence-backed parts is what makes assurance cases powerful. Instead of vague assurances, you get a clear chain of reasoning that can be challenged, verified, and improved.

## Review Your Learning Objectives

Let's review how you've met the learning objectives for this module:

<LearningObjectives

  variant="card"
  showProgress={true}
  objectives={[
    {
      id: 'obj-1',
      text: 'Identify the key components of an assurance case',
      description: 'You explored goals, strategies, property claims, evidence, and context elements',
      relatedTask: 'Exploration tasks'
    },
    {
      id: 'obj-2',
      text: 'Explain how structured arguments build trustworthiness',
      description: 'You traced the logical flow from claims to evidence',
      relatedTask: 'Reflection prompts'
    },
    {
      id: 'obj-3',
      text: 'Trace argument chains in real assurance cases',
      description: 'You followed strategies and connections in the Fair Recruitment AI case',
      relatedTask: 'Exploration activity'
    },
    {
      id: 'obj-4',
      text: 'Evaluate the strength and completeness of assurance arguments',
      description: 'You critically reflected on what makes arguments convincing',
      relatedTask: 'Reflection questions'
    }
  ]}
/>

## How Confident Do You Feel?

Before moving on, take a moment to assess your confidence in understanding these concepts:

<ConfidenceRating
  topic="Understanding how assurance cases structure arguments about AI trustworthiness"
  showFeedback={true}
  taskId="confidence-rating"
  useGlobalProgress={true}
/>

## What's Next?

You're now ready to move deeper into the world of assurance cases!

### Module 2: Building Blocks of Assurance *(coming soon)*

In the next module, you'll move from exploring to creating. You'll learn to:

- **Construct your own goals and strategies**
- **Identify appropriate evidence types**
- **Apply assurance case patterns** to common scenarios
- **Build simple arguments** from scratch

The Fair Recruitment AI case you explored today will serve as your reference model.

### Continue Your Journey

Here are some ways to deepen your understanding:

1. **Explore More Cases** - Visit the Hands-On Resources section to interact with more examples
2. **Join the Community** - Share your reflections and learn from others
3. **Dive Deeper** - Check out the Standalone Resources for more detailed guides

> **Remember**
>
> The power of TEA isn't just in the structure - it's in making complex arguments transparent and open to challenge. By breaking down "trust" into specific, evidence-backed claims, we can have meaningful conversations about whether systems are truly trustworthy.

## Module Complete!

You've finished the first module in your TEA journey. You can now:

- **Review your progress** using the tracker in the bottom-right
- **Continue to Module 2** *(coming soon)* to start building your own cases
- **Explore more examples** in the Hands-On Resources section
