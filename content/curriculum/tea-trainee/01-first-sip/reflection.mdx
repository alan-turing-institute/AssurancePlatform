# Reflection: Making Sense of What You Saw

## Reflection & Synthesis

Now that you've explored the Fair Recruitment AI case, let's reflect on what you've discovered. Take a few minutes to think deeply about your experience:

<ReflectionPrompts
  prompts={[
    {
      id: "first-impression",
      category: "Initial Understanding",
      title: "First Impressions",
      question:
        "What was your initial reaction when you first saw the Fair Recruitment AI assurance case? What stood out to you?",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      id: "argument-flow",
      category: "Structure Analysis",
      title: "Following the Logic",
      question:
        "How does the case build its argument from the main goal down to specific evidence? Can you describe the logical flow?",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      id: "convincing-aspects",
      category: "Critical Thinking",
      title: "Strengths and Weaknesses",
      question:
        "What aspects of this assurance case did you find most convincing? Were there any parts that seemed weak or incomplete?",
      required: false,
    },
    {
      id: "real-world",
      category: "Application",
      title: "Your Context",
      question:
        "Can you think of a system or decision in your own work where this structured approach to building trust would be valuable?",
      required: false,
    },
  ]}
  allowSkip={false}
  autoSave={true}
  showProgress={true}
  useGlobalProgress={true}
/>

## Naming What You Discovered

Congratulations! You've just explored your first assurance case. Let's name what you discovered:

### The Core Elements

You encountered five types of elements in the Fair Recruitment AI case:

1. **Goal** (Green) - The main claim: "The AI recruitment system makes fair and unbiased hiring recommendations"
2. **Strategies** (Purple) - Three approaches to argue fairness: bias detection, transparency, and monitoring
3. **Property Claims** (Orange) - Specific, measurable statements like "Training data has been audited"
4. **Evidence** (Cyan) - Concrete proof like audit reports and statistical analyses
5. **Context** (Grey) - Boundaries and definitions, like what "fairness" means legally

### The Key Insight

An assurance case works by **decomposing** a big claim (like "our AI is fair") into smaller, more manageable claims, and then providing evidence for each small claim. It's like building a pyramid of trust, where each level supports the one above it.

> **The Power of Decomposition**
>
> Breaking down complex claims into smaller, evidence-backed parts is what makes assurance cases powerful. Instead of vague assurances, you get a clear chain of reasoning that can be challenged, verified, and improved.
