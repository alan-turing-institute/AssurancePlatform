# React Flow Components Demo

This page demonstrates a new React Flow case viewer/editor, being developed as a curriculum component initially, before updating the main app. The case below represents a realistic AI-assisted medical diagnosis system assurance case, showcasing all element types and attributes.

<CaseViewerWrapper
  caseFile="design-reference-case.json"
  editable={true}
/>

## Development Notes

This page serves as the **design reference** for the Case Viewer redesign (Phase 2b). The assurance case above will be used to:

1. Develop and test the unified `AssuranceNode` component
2. Validate attribute display (assumption, justification, context)
3. Test ELK layout engine integration
4. Iterate on visual design before finalising

See `TASKS/Phase2/2b-prime-CurriculumModules/01-CaseViewer.md` for the full implementation plan.
