# Data Retention Policy

This policy explains how long we keep your data and what happens to inactive accounts.

## How long we keep your data

We keep your account and assurance cases for as long as you're actively using the platform. If you stop using your account, we'll keep your data for **2 years** after your last login before taking any action.

## What happens to inactive accounts

If you haven't logged in for 2 years, we'll:

1. **Send you a warning email** 30 days before we plan to delete your account
2. **Send a final reminder** 7 days before deletion
3. **Delete your account** if you don't log back in

Simply logging in resets the clock - your account will remain active for another 2 years from that point.

## Before we delete your account

Before deletion, you'll have the opportunity to:

- **Export your data** - download all your assurance cases
- **Log back in** - this cancels the deletion and keeps your account active

## What gets deleted

When we delete an inactive account, we remove:

- Your user profile and login details
- All assurance cases you created, including any shared with others
- Any comments or evidence you uploaded

If you've shared cases with collaborators, they will lose access when your account is deleted. We recommend transferring important shared work to another team member before your account becomes inactive.

## Questions

If you have questions about this policy or your data, contact us at [tea@turing.ac.uk](mailto:tea@turing.ac.uk).
